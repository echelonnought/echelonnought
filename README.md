### Hey there 👋


I'm Ngole Lawson from Buea, Cameroon, but my close friends call me echelonnought. I'm a fullstack JavaScript Developer, and I fancy solving problems using this tool.
I'd also programmed in PHP and Python early on in my web development career and I'd never stop pushing myself to learn more. I love following best practices when writing code so I ensure to keep it clean and readable as much as possible. When I'm not coding, I immerse my mind in good music and meditation. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on several projects for my portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more on data structures and algos
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about JavaScript 
- 📫 How to reach me: @ngole_lawson
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: It is a myth that humans only use 10 percent of our brain. We actually use all of it. We’re even using more than 10 percent when we sleep
