### Hey there ðŸ‘‹


I'm Ngole Lawson from Buea, Cameroon, but my close friends call me echelonnought. I'm a fullstack JavaScript Developer, and I fancy solving problems using this tool.
I'd also programmed in PHP and Python early on in my web development career and I'd never stop pushing myself to learn more. I love following best practices when writing code so I ensure to keep it clean and readable as much as possible. When I'm not coding, I immerse my mind in good music and meditation. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects for my portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more on data structures and algos
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source Projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @ngole_lawson
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: It is a myth that we only use 10 percent of our brain. We actually use all of it. Weâ€™re even using more than 10 percent when we sleep
