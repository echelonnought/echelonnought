### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Ngole Lawson
#### Fullstack Software Developer
I'm Ngole Lawson from Buea, Cameroon, but my close friends call me echelonnought. I'm a fullstack JavaScript Developer, and I fancy solving problems using this tool. I'd also programmed in PHP and Python early on in my web development career and I'd never stop pushing myself to learn more. I love following best practices when writing code so I ensure to keep it clean and readable as much as possible. When I'm not coding, I immerse my mind in good music and meditation.

Skills:  REACT / JS / HTML / CSS/ ANGULAR
